# Deblurring Optically Distrted Dataset

This is the code for a project for my summer internship done at colorlab in NTNU in Gj√∏vik. 

## Introduction
Optical aberrations pose significant challenges in the field of image quality assessment and enhancement. The Colourlab Image Dataset: Optical Aberrations (CID:OA), introduced recently, provides a comprehensive collection of images with various optical distortions, such as defocus, vertical astigmatism, and spherical aberrations, at four distinct levels each.

In this project, we evaluated multiple conventional and deep learning-based image enhancement techniques on the CID:OA dataset to understand their effectiveness in mitigating optical distortions. Additionally, the models were tested on blurred images from the TID2013 dataset, which includes Gaussian blur across five different levels, enabling us to compare their performance across datasets with different distortion characteristics.

## Evalauation Metrics
Metrics such as **MSSIM**, **FSIM**, **PSNR**, **LPC** **BRISQUE**, **CPBD**, and **JNB** were used to quantitatively assess the deblurred images' quality.
